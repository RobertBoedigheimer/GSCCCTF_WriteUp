# Case Of The Mondays

Ah, the frustrating, enigmatic, reviled Case of the Mondays challenge.... You were over-thinking it.

The clue:

> Part of this flag has been leaked! gscc-*i\*\*m*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*f*\*\*e\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Additionally, there is a link that shows you this:

In this challenge, you know part of the clue already. This is essential to being able to figure it out.

Other than the fact that the both the clue and the flag are references to the same movie, the words in the clue
are quite irrelevant. Also, the italicized characters are irrelevant, except in that they are not bold.

So, you might have pulled out all the bold letters and tried to unscramble them or see if they were the representation of some known cipher. 

The only relevant thing about them is how many contiguous bold characters there are in each group. If you start counting you get:
3
4
5
5
1
etc.

You know the exact length of the clue so after counting the groups of bold letters you might notice the count is the same number of letters in the flag. This should lead you to deduce that 3 = g, 4 = s, 5 = c and 1 = -

Continuing on, you can fill in all of the letters that you know, which leaves you with a little guessing or trial and error.

The flag reminds you that Granite State Code Camp encourages you to express yourself with *gscc-minimum-flair-fifteen-pieces*

If you are from the USA or Canada and you do not get the reference the please immediately turn in your geek card until further review.
