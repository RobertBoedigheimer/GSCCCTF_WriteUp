# Ask and ye shall receive

The clue is:

> The flag should be easy to GET

The give-away here is the capitalized "GET". If you recongnize this as an HTTP method you might be thinking that you can craft a special request that returns the flag.

You would be right! Take another hint from the word "flag" and initiate a GET request to https://gsccctf.azurewebsites.net/flag

This request displays the flag and gives you a little information about what OWASP security issue it represents.
